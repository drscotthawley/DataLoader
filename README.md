## Intro

Little is known of DJ DataLoader, a mythical figure in the Easter European Dubstep scene.  He is a group hallucination, a shadow of the ideal DJ. 

The fact that DataLoader was producing hot drops as far back as 2015 that sound exactly like 2022-era text-conditioned audio diffusion models is a marvel.  Some have even speculated that this provides evidence for the existence of time travel. 

## Guidelines for Contributing

* **Who can contribute**: Anyone can contribute to the myth of DataLoader -- music (primarily), graphics, fiction. 

* **Editor**: @drscotthawley will serve as the "editor" (as with a book of submitted essays), and retain "editorial" control over "lore" and what constitutes "cannon" and what doesn't.

* **License**: For the purposes of avoiding dispute, all materials assume a licence of [CC-NC-4.0: Creative Commons - Non-Commerical](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).  No one owns these, no one monetizes them.  DataLoader is a gift to the world. 

*  **Song titles**: ML puns in song titles are encouraged, especially repurposing words from ML or diffusion models 
e.g. activation->"Act Evasion", regulator->"Reggae You Later", something about infilling->"Infill Traitor".
As are titles that are over-the-top, 'Apextacy', 'Wrecktoplasm', 'Lord of the Dubstep', 'Suck on This':  DataLoader is a bit of a cocky bastard.

* **AI Generation vs. Human-Edited**: If songs are completely AI-generated, that's fine. If you edited them a fair amount, that's fine too.  This is a giant romp of fun, folks, not an academic study. 

* **How to Submit**: Open an Issue, provide links or attachments there.  If you'd rather try to stay anonymous, you can do the Brother Lawrence trick of "I have heard of someone who made this..." 

* **Time Frame**: (Semi-) Official DataLoader albums releases will be comprised of contributions of submitted materials, subject to arbitrary standards of quality, "coolness", etc.  

* **Standards**: "Does it slap?"  DataLoader, being a cocky bastard, does have a bit of a reputation to uphold, so don't just press "Generate" and accept whatever.  But if you're upset that your submission doesn't make it into an official release, then feel free to release it yourself, and just claim that it's a bootleg obtained from, say Japan. For example:
